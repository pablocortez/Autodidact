<h2 class="wsite-content-title" style="text-align:left;"><u>About the Autodidact institute</u><br /></h2>

<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp; My name is Pablo Cortez, I am a high school sophomore, and I  really like helping others whenever I can. By creating this website, I  thought I could help others easily. My goal is to help others like me in  their quest to learning anything they want. Sometimes, school can be an  obstacle, rather than a tool, when it comes to learning. During the  final months of school, I had been exhausted, only sleeping for a few  hours a day, mostly after I got home from school. I did great during the  school year, getting some of the highest grades at my school and  competing intra-regionally for Varsity Quiz and mathematics, my favorite  subject. Assuming that  hard work was the main reason why I did well in the past school year  is  quite a superficial way of looking at it. And it is rather incorrect.   Things that appear to be hard work, if done on account of interest,   should not be considered hard work for <a style="" title="" href="http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/hard">the adjective <em style="">hard</em> is defined as "requiring a great deal of endurance or effort"</a>.   In the past couple of months, rather than doing anything that required  a  great deal of endurance or effort, I had been engaging in activities   that I enjoyed: reading books and articles about things that piqued my   interests, watching videos on <a style="" title="" href="http://www.youtube.com/user/Vsauce">Youtube</a> and Coursera, programming, building websites and applications, and doing graphical designing. <br /><br />The key here is not hard work, but interest.  <br /><br />When a person is interested in something, take soccer  for example, and likes to participate in certain activities, such as  practicing a scissor kick  (a trick in soccer), she/he does it  ungrudgingly and enjoys it,  and therefore would have a higher tendency  to stay focused throughout the  entire process. This helps in both the  accumulation of information and  the development of cognitive and  psycho-motor skills. And during the  process, the person would  experience an increase in the level of dopamine in her/his brain and, as a result, would be positively <a style="" title="" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement">reinforced</a> without requiring any actual extrinsic motivation,   for instance, the reward one receives upon coming up first in a soccer  tournament. In another words, she/he would be motivated intrinsically.   People who are motivated intrinsically would be more likely to carry on   with the activity even when it consists of difficult tasks. This is   particularly true for the process of knowledge acquisition, which is why   rather than being an orthodox student and studying hard, I learn about  things that I  like enthusiastically because I find them interesting.  And I was given  the opportunity to do so this summer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to sustain an interest in what one is learning, one should   employ a customized methodology that is most suitable for her/him.   Diverse methodologies to study a certain subject is something the   current education system is not doing a good job providing students   with. This is no surprise for a system <a style="" title="" href="http://www.ted.com/talks/sir_ken_robinson_bring_on_the_revolution.html">built on a fast-food model instead of a model based on principles of agriculture</a>.   Students are to follow a standardized procedure to study a subject,   quite resembling how data are transferred from a machine to another   using <a style="" title="" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP/IP">TCP/IP</a>  in a  network. They are assigned to learn a set of facts confined in  what we  know as "syllabus" in a predetermined order similar to how  machines are  assigned to execute a set of tasks in a deterministic  algorithm. It is  true that some students may design their own approach  to study a subject  with the help of teachers or parents, but that is  inadequate as long as  the confinement exists.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So,  the upshot here is that the most efficient way to be good at  something  is to do what you are interested in. This means that if you  are  interested in something which you want to pursue in life because  that  is who you are or who you want to be, just go for it, unshackled by   others' opinion about you. If you want to excel in something you are   not so keen on, try finding the enthusiasm for it, in another words   using <a style="" title="" href="http://0.0ar.ch/article/760-forSAT2">neuroplasticity</a>   to get yourself intrinsically motivated. This can be a little bit  tricky  as you are trying to convince yourself to be interested in  something  that you are not. You have to have strong and  self-justifiable reasons  behind it and reasons as shallow as being able  to do well in a test do  not qualify as one. If you are not yet sure  about what your interests  are, just keep searching for them as you  explore different things in  life, and one day you would discover that  they have always been in the  unconscious mind of yours, influencing  your decision making, and you  were just not aware of them. 	<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the basis for autodidacticism, and I want to encourage  everyone reading this to become an autodidact. I find it to be the only  way that I can truly learn; memorizing random facts and testing on them  is, in a nutshell, what modern education has come to be. Screw that. <br /><span><br /><span>Yours truly, <br /><span>Pablo Cortez, founder of AI</span></span></span><br /><span><span><span><br /></span></span></span></div></div>
